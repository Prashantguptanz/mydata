MyData User Guide
=================

MyData is a desktop application (initially targeting Windows) for uploading data to MyTardis (https://github.com/mytardis/mytardis).

We begin with a root data directory (e.g. "C:\MyTardisUsers") containing one folder for each MyTardis user.  In the example below, we have two users with MyTardis usernames "skeith" and "wettenhj".

Within each user folder, we can add as many folders as we like, and each one will become a "dataset" within MyTardis:

The MyData application (which can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/wettenhj/mydata/raw/master/UserGuideImages/MyData_v0.0.1.exe) can be configured to start up automatically each time Windows starts up.  (The current proposed deployment site switches off their microscope PCs every night and turns them back on in the morning.)  The first time you run the application, you will be asked to enter some settings, telling the application how to connect to your MyTardis instance.  You can use a MyTardis account which is shared amongst facility managers, but which general users don't have access to:
