MyData User Guide
=================

MyData is a desktop application (initially targeting Windows) for uploading data to MyTardis (https://github.com/mytardis/mytardis).

We begin with a root data directory (e.g. "C:\MyTardisUsers") containing one folder for each MyTardis user.  In the example below, we have two users with MyTardis usernames "skeith" and "wettenhj".

Within each user folder, we can add as many folders as we like, and each one will become a "dataset" within MyTardis:
